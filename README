This program was made as a prize winning solution for a programming contest called MobMe CodeJam.It is implemented using regular Hashtable as well as with 
the BloomFilter data structure.  
 
Dependancies(using Hashtable)
1. Dictionary used by spellchecker(dictionary.txt)
2. Word Database used by spellingsuggest(wordprobabilityDatabase)
3. Input Text File used by spellchecker(inputtext.txt)

Usage
The source files along with the dependancies have been sent. Compile the source code($javac spellchecker.java) and then run its class($java spellchecker).
